I'm so happy
'Cause today I've found my friends
They're in my head
I'm so ugly, but that's okay
'Cause so are you, we broke our mirrors
Sunday morning is everyday
For all I care, and I'm not scared
Light my candles in a daze
'Cause I've found God
Yeah, yeah

I'm so lonely, but that's ok
I shaved my head, and I'm not sad
And just maybe I'm to blame
For all I've heard, but I'm not sure
I'm so excited
I can't wait to meet you there, but I don't care
I'm so horny
But that's okay, my will is good
Yeah, yeah

I like iy (I'm not gonna crack)
I miss you (I'm not gonna crack)
I love you (I'm not gonna crack)
I killed you (I'm not gonna crack)

I like iy (I'm not gonna crack)
I miss you (I'm not gonna crack)
I love you (I'm not gonna crack)
I killed you (I'm not gonna crack)

I'm so happy
